# Discord Bot Source
This is a repository of all the code for a Discord bot. If
you are going to use this for your own use, please
[view the license](https://github.com/doesN0tComput3/discord-bot/blob/master/LICENSE)
before you take the code.
## Installing The Bot
Lets get to installing the bot!
### Fork The Repository
Before we even get started, fork the repo.

Note: I assume that you know how to fork a repository.
### Create the bot and insert your token
Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/.
If you haven't already created your bot,
click on **New Application**. Then, on
the left, click on **Bot**. Under Token,
click **Copy**. Now, go to the forked
config.ts file. On line 2, replace
"YOUR TOKEN HERE" with your token that
you just copied. That's it.
## What's next?
Well, I will be updating this repository whenever Dapper
Dino adds command tutorials. I STRONGLY suggest watching
them. There is a link above to the playlist. It is also
important to
[keep your fork synced with this repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced),
so that when I roll out new features, they will sync with your forked copy.
I also will be adding README's to the commands, so please be keep your fork
synced with the repo. Thanks.
